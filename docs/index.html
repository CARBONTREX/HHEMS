            The Energy Challenge Facing Dutch Households
          </h2>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            As energy costs continue to rise and the Netherlands pushes toward
            ambitious climate goals, Dutch households find themselves at the
            center of a complex energy transition. While the promise of smart
            energy management exists, current solutions remain prohibitively
            expensive, overly complex, or locked within proprietary ecosystems
            that limit user control and innovation.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The growing adoption of solar panels, electric vehicles, and home
            batteries creates new opportunities for energy optimization, but
            also new challenges. Homeowners need tools to coordinate these
            devices intelligently, maximizing renewable energy use while
            minimizing costs. Unfortunately, existing solutions often require
            significant upfront investments and technical expertise that put
            them out of reach for many families.

            Introducing HHEMS: A New Approach
          </h2>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Hybrid Home Energy Management System (HHEMS) represents a
            fundamentally different approach to home energy management. Built as
            an open-source platform at TU Delft and part of the
            <a
              href="https://cesi-nl.github.io/"
              class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline"
              >Convergence</a
            >
            initiative, the HHEMS project combines the accessibility of
            Raspberry Pi hardware with the extensive device support of Home
            Assistant, creating a solution that is both powerful and
            approachable.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            What sets HHEMS apart is its hybrid nature. The platform can easily
            integrate with real hardware devices through Home Assistant's
            extensive ecosystem, while also providing sophisticated simulation
            capabilities for expensive and hard to acquire devices like solar
            panels, electric vehicles, battery systems, and more. This means
            researchers can test energy management algorithms without expensive
            hardware investments, and homeowners can experiment with different
            scenarios before committing to major purchases.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
            How HHEMS Works
          </h2>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            At its core, HHEMS leverages
            <a
              href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"
              target="_blank"
              class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline"
              >Home Assistant</a
            >'s extensive ecosystem of device integrations. Home Assistant is an
            open-source home automation platform that runs on local hardware and
            supports thousands of different smart devices and services. This
            means the HHEMS platform can communicate with hundreds of different
            smart home devices and energy systems right out of the box. The
            system provides APIs that abstract away the complexity of hardware
            communication, allowing researchers to focus on energy optimization
            algorithms rather than low-level device control.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            HHEMS incorporates a comprehensive simulation tool powered by
            <a

              >DEMKit</a
            >, a project developed by TU Twente which allows us to simulate
            energy devices such as solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles,
            and other smart home equipment. From an outside perspective of a
            researcher or household user, there is no difference between real
            and virtual devices during interaction with the platform. This
            seamless integration makes HHEMS particularly valuable for research
            and education, providing a realistic testing environment without the
            need for expensive physical hardware.

            Why HHEMS?
          </h2>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            HHEMS serves two primary user groups: homeowners with smart home
            devices like solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles who want
            to optimize their energy usage and costs, and researchers who need a
            platform for developing and testing energy management algorithms
            without expensive hardware investments.

            Looking Toward the Future
          </h2>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The current implementation of HHEMS represents just the beginning of
            our vision for democratized energy management. Future developments
            will focus on creating networks of connected households that can
            share energy and coordinate consumption patterns at the community
            level.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We envision neighborhoods where homes automatically share excess
            solar power, where electric vehicles serve as mobile energy storage
            for the community, and where centralized energy trading systems help
            optimize costs across multiple households. These connected
            communities will form the building blocks of self-sustaining virtual
            power plants that contribute to a more resilient and sustainable
            energy grid.

            Mobile App Development
          </h2>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            While Home Assistant provides powerful automation capabilities, its
            interface isn't always intuitive for everyday users and doesn't
            prioritize user experience for energy management tasks. To address
            this gap, we are developing a dedicated mobile app focused on user
            experience and ease of use. This app is being developed by 5
            students as part of the CSE2000 software project course over a span
            of 10 weeks. The mobile app will provide an intuitive interface for
            homeowners to monitor their energy usage, control devices, and
            optimize their energy management strategies. More details will be
            added soon.
